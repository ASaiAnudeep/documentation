## Test Framework Integration
[ ![Integrations](Images/userGuide/import/Integrations.png) ](Images/userGuide/import/Integrations.png)

ReportPortal is a system that **integrates with your Test Framework**, listens events in it and visualizes test results. You can not execute results right from ReportPortal.

But you can:

* integrate ReportaPortal with your Test Framework
* receive all needed information about results of test cases executions: a test name, a test status, a test duration, parameters, attachments (files, screenshots, video and other), logs and others

If you decide to integrate your test framework with ReportPortal what should you do?

First, we propose you to start you exploration with our examples, that help you to try ReportPortal in action without any efforts.

| Testframe works | Examples|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Java TestFrameworks |https://github.com/reportportal/examples-java  |
| JavaScript based TestFrameworks |in progress |

Now when you understand how integration works, you will be able to configure your own reporting.
Choose which combination of agent, client and logger you need, and follow the instructions which has been provided inside each agents.

Please find full list of available integrations with test frameworks from the box in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/reportportal). 

What you can do if you can not find your Test Framework?
You can create your own custom integrations. For that reasons, please look at [page](https://reportportal.io/docs/How-to-implement).

>**Note:**
> We can propose a paid support for integration with a new framework or supporting exsisting one. If you need more details, please drop a letter on support@reportportal.io.
