The table with log messages is painted in different colors depending on the log
type:

>   red - for failed log steps

>   green - for log steps with positive validation made

>   blue - for system messages

Error logs are always highlighted in red. The others are highlighted on mouse
hover only.

Logs with *Trace*, *Debug*, *Error* labels are collapsed, if the log has more
than 5 lines. You can expand log message clicking on special "Expand"
button.
