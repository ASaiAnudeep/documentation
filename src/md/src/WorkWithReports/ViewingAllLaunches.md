# Viewing all launches 
You have two options to browse all project launches. By default system displays all launches of the project in one list in order of start time.

Also you have possibility to optimize this list. If you choose **‘Latest Launches’** option  from the drop-down list (All Launches\ Latest Launches) at the top of the page, it will allow you to roll up the list  to latest launches only. 

In other words, when that option is turn on, you will see on a launches view only launches with unique names with the last increment (#number). 

*For example, there are launches with names ‘Demo#1’,   ‘Demo#2’, ‘Demo#3’ on a launches view. If you choose ‘Latest Launches’ option, the system will display ‘Demo#3’ launch only.*

In a Latest Launches view you may perform any regular actions: add filter, perform actions from Actions menu, edit tags, and edit description.
