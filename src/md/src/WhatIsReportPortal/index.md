What is ReportPortal?
==============

ReportPortal is a service, that provides increased capabilities to speed up results analysis and reporting through the use of built-in analytic features.

ReportPortal is a great addition to the Continuous Integration and Continuous
Testing process.

It seamlessly integrates with mainstream platforms such as Jenkins, Jira, BDD process, majority of Functional and Unit testing frameworks.

Real-time integration provides businesses the ability to manage and track execution status directly from ReportPortal.

Test case execution results are stored following the same structure you have in your reporting suites and test plan. The test cases are shown with all related data in one place, right where you need it: logs, screenshots, binary data. The execution pipeline of certain test cases are also available for you, so one can see previous execution results in one click.

ReportPortal also gives you the ability to collaboratively analyze test automation results. Particular test cases can be associated with a product bug, an automation issue, a system issue or can be submitted as an issue ticket directly from the execution result. 

ReportPortal provides enhanced capabilities along with auto-results analysis by
leveraging historical data of test execution.

With each execution ReportPortal automatically figures out the root cause of a fail, doing analysis itself, and marking it with a flag so that engineers will be alerted to the issue to see if its been resolved or which test results require actual human analysis.
